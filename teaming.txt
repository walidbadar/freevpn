Create the team interface connection profile with nmcli (static IP addressing):
nmcli connection add type team con-name myteam ifname team0 config '{"runner": {"name": "activebackup"}, "link_watch": {"name": "ethtool"}}' ip4 222.22.1.22/24 10.0.1.31/8

Create a profile for each team port (slave):
nmcli connection add type team-slave con-name myteam-port1 ifname eno53 master team0
nmcli connection add type team-slave con-name myteam-port2 ifname eno54 master team0

Delete connection by name via Network Manager:
nmcli connection delete id <connection name>

Bring the team and port interfaces up/down:
nmcli dev dis INAME
nmcli con up CNAME

INAME is the device name of the team or port interface to be managed.
CNAME is the connection name of the team or port interface to be managed.
