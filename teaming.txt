Create the team interface connection profile with nmcli (static IP addressing):
nmcli connection add type team con-name myteam ifname team0 config '{"runner": {"name": "activebackup"}, "link_watch": {"name": "ethtool"}}' ip4 222.22.1.222/24 gw4 222.22.1.224 ip4 10.0.1.31/8

Create a profile for each team port (slave):
nmcli connection add type team-slave con-name myteam-port1 ifname enp0s8 master team0
nmcli connection add type team-slave con-name myteam-port2 ifname enp0s9 master team0

Delete connection by name via Network Manager:
nmcli connection delete id 'connection name'

Bring the team and port interfaces up/down:
nmcli dev dis 'INAME'
nmcli con up 'CNAME'

INAME is the device name of the team or port interface to be managed.
CNAME is the connection name of the team or port interface to be managed.
